In that time, I've enjoyed monthly or sometimes twice monthly sessions.\n","\n","Today, I was sick and in the interest of not wanting to spread my illness, I called at the opening of business, to let them know I was sick.  I was told that I would be charged 50% of the standard rate for the cancellation.  The young lady was pleasant and asked if she could run the credit card on file for the fee.  I replied that I was mixed in my mind as to the charge, and that I would sort the charge when I wasn't sick.  I told her that I may be a bit agitated due to the illness, and wanted to have a clear head prior to addressing the charge.\n","\n","Five minutes later, I received a notification from American Express that my card had been charged the cancellation fee.  I called back and asked if they had charged my card for the cancellation fee.  She replied that she did not but her manager had charged me.  I asked if she had relayed my message to the manager and she said she had.  I asked to speak with the manager.\n","\n","I was greeted by Bo(sp?).  I asked him if the young lady had relayed my concern and he said she had not, but that he had to charge me under the rules.  I asked if he saw any problem with charging my card when I expressly told them not to use the card.  He cut me off by saying, \"The problem is you not showing up for your appointment.\"  His insolent tone was like none I've heard from a nationwide chain.\n","\n","My anger at this point made me respond with a firm, \"Excuse me???\"  His tone continued to show his lack of respect and professionalism.  I demanded that he cancel my membership.  To this he responded apathetically and with a disrespectful tone.  I told him that I would come down there to resolve the issue.\n","\n","After time to cool down, I called and asked for his superior's name.  He told me Debbie was the owner. I asked to speak with her.  He told me should would be in around 2PM.  I asked him to have her return my call as soon as possible.\n","\n","I then told him that I was dissapointed with his tone and was hoping for an apology.  He very disrespectfully told me \"Why would I apologize when I haven't done anything wrong?\"  This was said as a statement rather than a question.  He then told me he had witnesses in the form of the girl I had initially talked to that would back up his story.  I responded that we'll see how that works out when I contact corporate and write a review.\n","\n","I would have probably paid the cancellation fee if I had been treated professionally.  Respect and professionalism is a foundation for any business, particularly in the service industry.  I was shocked that someone like Bo can be put into a position of customer interaction at a managerial level.
